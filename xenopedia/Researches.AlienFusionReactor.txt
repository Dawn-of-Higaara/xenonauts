<desc>The Alien Fusion Reactor is a large circular construction used to power the larger extraterrestrial capital ships.  It consists of a central Alenium core and a toroidal outer ring that produces a powerful magnetic field to contain the fusion reaction and the 2.2 billion Celsius temperatures that accompany it. &#10;&#10;The reactor is not actually fuelled directly by Alenium. The Alenium is used to power the energy fields needed to smash together deuterium (a hydrogen isotope) nuclei and generate fusion, a process that itself emits a vast amount of energy - the Alenium just acts as a &quot;starter motor&quot; for the process. As deuterium is freely available and not required in large quantities, this allows a weight of Alenium to release vastly more energy than it itself contains. The limiting factor is the intricacy of the design - the Fusion Reactor is much more advanced and would take far longer to build than a pure-Alenium reactor. It is therefore ideal for larger alien vessels, which have vast power demands but are sufficiently important to warrant use of such a valuable device.&#10;&#10;We have built a miniaturised fusion reactor in our laboratory using techniques learned from studying the alien design. Shrinking the reactor has caused some loss of efficiency, but relative to its size (no larger than a car engine) it generates at least twenty times more power than anything previously built - it actually puts out almost as much energy as our base reactor. In any case, the ability to obtain vastly increased amounts of power from our existing energy stores is likely to lead to further technological advance.</desc>
