<desc>The Buzzard Jumpsuit is a variant of the Wolf Battle Armour designed for mobility over protective ability. It is fitted with an integrated jump unit, a device that allows the wearer to move vertically on the battlefield. Refinement of the armour plate has decreased weight, slightly reducing protection but letting the soldier carry more into battle. &#10;&#10;The jump unit is a rather substantial device worn in a back harness. It consists of a miniaturised Alenium reactor connected to a pair of thrusters that sit above the wearer's shoulders, paired with various gyroscopic flight control systems and sensors. Though the jump unit is not powerful enough for prolonged flight, the user is able to hover for short periods if necessary. Even those who are not trained as pilots should find it easy enough to use in combat - input from the wearer is recorded via touchpads in the gloves, allowing them to steer their intended flight path (sadly also preventing them from using weapons while airborne). A complex array of vectored thrust ports copied from the alien directional thruster design provide fine control and auto-stabilisation when in flight. &#10;&#10;Clearly, the ability to &quot;jump&quot; atop buildings or leap impassable terrain has utility on the battlefield - particularly for your scouts and marksmen. Soldiers regularly exposed to enemy fire will likely still need the added protection of the Wolf, however.</desc>
