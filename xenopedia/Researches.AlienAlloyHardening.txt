<desc>The armour plate on alien capital ships is thicker than that on a smaller UFO, but offers far more protection than can be explained by the additional depth. Laboratory tests suggest that it is almost fifty percent more effective at absorbing damage than standard alien armour plate of similar size and weight. Given the fundamental composition of the two types of plating is not dramatically different, the extra strength must have arisen from the production process (the same as separates a diamond from a lump of coal).&#10;&#10;The atomic structure of the alloy yields the explanation. Like terrestrial metals, most alien alloys have a crystalline form when solid - a compact and orderly arrangement of atoms. However, the various alloys used in the hardened plate are amorphous rather than crystalline. Amorphous materials instead have an irregular and disorderly atom arrangement that prevents the formation of microscopic lines of weakness that can exist in crystalline structures, giving the hardened plate enhanced heat and impact resistance.&#10;&#10;This phenomenon is hardly unknown to science - exactly the same thing occurs when hot steel is quenched in cold water. However, applying the process to alien materials is far more difficult: preventing the formation of a crystalline structure in some alloys can require cooling of up to a hundred million degrees per second. Prohibitive at the start of the war, perhaps, but my intellect (admittedly paired with alien materials) was able to overcome the obstacles entirely. The cooling process consumes large amounts of Alenium, but we can now produce these hardened materials on a sufficiently large scale to incorporate them into our own designs.</desc>
