<desc>The X-59 &quot;Marauder&quot; is an advanced interceptor designed to counter all known alien craft. It is fast, durable and well-armed (equipped with both a cannon and heavy torpedoes) and can perform the Combat Roll maneuver in combat. These characteristics make it just as adept at dealing with small alien interceptors as it is attacking large capital ships.&#10;&#10;Our greatest advances in performance came from setting aside the old conventions of aircraft design. The fuselage of the Marauder contains a network of powerful integrated thrusters that provide lift and propulsion, with the stubby forward-swept wings mostly being employed for fine maneuvering. While these wings contribute heavily to the overall agility of the interceptor, it is actually entirely capable of flying without them. The same can be said for the tail / vertical stabilisers, where the traditional vertical arrangement has also been replaced with a more unusual forked design.&#10;&#10;With few aerodynamic concerns, we have been able to focus our attention on combat performance instead. The armour plated &quot;shell&quot; of the craft is fabricated entirely from hardened alien materials and is nearly four inches thick in some areas, making it more akin to a flying tank than a normal interceptor. The extra engine thrust allows it to carry both a cannon and heavy torpedoes, making it a much more rounded combatant than any of its predecessors. The resulting interceptor is squat, ugly and capable of destroying almost anything it encounters (much like our engineers).</desc>
