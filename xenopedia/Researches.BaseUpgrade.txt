<desc>Having covered our scientific exploits in unlocking the secrets of the alien base in my last report, this covers the resulting improvements to our own facilities. The greatest improvements have been seen in our Laboratories and Workshops - both structures now allow scientists or engineers to work almost 50% more efficiently than before. Our new biological computers and instruments mean that my team are no longer entirely reliant on our own (ample) brainpower and have been able to fully automate several formerly time-consuming tasks, giving us more time to think. I have also had our upgraded laboratories soundproofed, allowing the brilliant minds among us to work without being disturbed by the less brilliant.&#10;&#10;There have also been a number of less obvious improvements to our base - e.g. the refit of base kitchens with laser-based ovens capable of cooking food in mere seconds, or the upgraded recreational areas with holographic entertainment consoles. Both of these have proved immensely popular, but unfortunately the replacement of the showers in the Living Quarters with (vastly-superior) alien gel sacs proved less popular. Events culminated in an incident with some of your soldiers, leading to the upgrade being postponed for now...but I hope you will discipline your men accordingly.&#10;&#10;Finally, we have developed an internal network that links all of our systems together, whether the same facility or not. This morning we were able to transmit a mildly amusing image of a cat halfway across the world, suggesting it will be an excellent tool for sharing classified information within our organisation. I named this impressive creation the &quot;internetwork&quot;, and would be very surprised if it did not catch on.</desc>
