<desc>Basic Armour is standard-issue equipment for our strike teams. It does not offer much in the way of protection, but does not encumber the wearer in any way nor reduce his situational awareness.&#10;&#10;It has been designed primarily for function; providing the soldier protection from the elements and enough carrying space to hold all of his equipment. The only concession to protective equipment is the steel helmet, which offers a measure of protection against shrapnel or other flying debris. We know little about extraterrestrial weapons at this point in time, so there is little point in slowing our men down with protective equipment that may well have no effect at all. A few of your men have remarked on the visibility of the fetching blue used, too - it is highly unlikely that the aliens see in the same visual spectrum as we do, so camouflage is likely wasted effort. Better our men know exactly where their comrades are at all times.&#10;&#10;We should be able to design protective equipment tailored to defend against alien weapons once we have captured and studied a few examples. In the meantime, the men will be relying on your tactical abilities to keep them out of harm's way.</desc>
