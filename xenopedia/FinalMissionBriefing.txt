<desc>The objective of this operation is simple - kill the alien High Praetor. The fate of the entire human race rests on the death of this one alien. The captured Praetor has provided access codes for the uppermost level of the Dreadnought. It will not be long until the aliens realise what is happening: the dropship will unload your men in the landing bay and disengage immediately. We are unsure if it will be able to withdraw before the alien guns come online, but the pilots are prepared to give their lives if necessary.&#10;&#10;The High Praetor will be directly ahead of your men when they land. Your men must overcome all alien resistance and slay their commander. You must act quickly - the Reapers from the lower decks will begin clambering through the access tubes towards the bridge as soon as the High Praetor calls them. They will take some time to arrive, but there will be too many to fight. Your men must kill the High Praetor before they are overwhelmed.&#10;&#10;A final twist: the Dreadnought's escape pods will only activate if the vessel is in danger. Destroying the two nearby power cores will activate the escape pods, but will take valuable time. However, you may not have time to double back for them if you immediately march on the palace. You must decide whether it is worth risking the survival of our entire planet to save those who have fought so hard to protect it.&#10;&#10;Act as you see fit, Commander. Destiny awaits.</desc>
