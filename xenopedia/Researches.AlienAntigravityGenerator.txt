<desc>The largest alien vessels we encounter cruising through our skies must weigh so much that we simply could not understand how they could stay airborne using only their thrusters. This Anti-Gravity Generator reveals the brilliant solution: create a device that reduces the weight of the ship. &#10;&#10;A simple explanation - weight is the force acting on an object due to gravity. This device creates a localised field that negates any gravitational pull acting on objects within the field, leaving them otherwise unaffected (and their mass unchanged) but reducing their weight enormously. This allows a UFO to fly using only a fraction of the thrust that would otherwise be needed / could plausibly be generated - indeed, any capital ship that suffered a field malfunction in our atmosphere would meet a rather abrupt end.&#10;&#10;The function of the device revolves around gravitons, which are the force carriers for gravity in much the same way that photons are the force carriers for electromagnetic radiation (such as light). This device emits a stream of anti-gravitons that pair up with gravitons in the nearby area, annihilating one another in a process that reduces the gravitation force acting on the area. This device can annihilate over ninety percent of the nearby gravitons, leading to a corresponding ninety percent drop in the weight of anything inside the field. It should be easy enough to replicate the technology and use it in our own designs; I have no doubt that it will prove to be a very useful discovery.</desc>
