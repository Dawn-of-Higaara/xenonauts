<desc>Tissue analysis on the remains of different extraterrestrial species has allowed us to compare them with one another in an attempt to find characteristics common to them all. Though we have no definite answers, there are hints as to the origins of the aliens.&#10;&#10;There are strong similarities in the physiology of all biological alien units encountered so far: for example, all are humanoid. All also possess both a circulatory system and central nervous system, albeit with some variation in function. This allows for the possibility of a common planetary origin; the huge variety of life on our own planet clearly illustrates that an array of vastly different creatures can evolve simultaneously on a single planet. This was our initial assumption, largely due to the shared habitat inside the alien UFOs - an atmosphere containing perhaps 5-6% oxygen, rather than the 21% of ours. The aliens respire via oxygen in much the same manner as humans do, using a common vector to distribute it around the body: a semi-synthetic protein that mimics the role of human haemoglobin, but much more effectively (and giving alien blood a distinctive purple tint).&#10;&#10;However, the fundamental organic chemistry is so dramatically different between alien species that a common origin cannot be possible. The reason these species can share a common habitat is not evolution, but rather extensive genetic engineering. This oxygen-carrying protein bears no resemblance to any other part of any of the corpses studied - in other words, it appears an external force has engineered these creatures to be capable of breathing the same air that they do. The identity of this external force and the reasoning behind this decision remain obscure, at least for now.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, we are turning this research to practical use. My team have constructed holding tanks in the laboratories which can be used to confine captured alien units in a low-oxygen environment (if exposed to our atmosphere for long enough, alien units will eventually succumb to oxygen toxicity), allowing us to study them more closely.</desc>
