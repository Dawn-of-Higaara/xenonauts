<desc>This low-grade Alenium can also be used to upgrade the missiles carried by our interceptors. This process was slightly more involved, as our anti-air warheads rely on armour penetration as much as explosive force. Nonetheless, we have been successful - and as the new warheads can be fitted to our existing rocket engines, we have already upgraded your interceptors accordingly.&#10;&#10;The required armour penetration is achieved by fitting a small laser emitter to the top of the Alenium block. This fires in a pre-determined pattern, which can be changed to allow us to shape and focus the explosive charge in any direction that we choose. With no time to conduct extensive studies on the effectiveness of different charge patterns, we instead just ensured that the energy from the blast is focused forwards rather than wastefully radiating in all directions. Crude, perhaps, but certainly functional.&#10;&#10;The Alenium Missile is a direct replacement for the Sidewinder light air-to-air missile, whilst the Alenium Torpedo replaces the heavy Avalanche torpedo. The latter is a powerful weapon well suited to dealing with lumbering alien craft without the speed or agility to avoid it, the former a faster missile that inflicts less damage but is more likely to hit alien lighter vessels. In both cases the upgrades are just straightforward warhead swaps, so this should not dictate any major change in aerial tactics beyond making our engagements a little easier.</desc>
