<desc>Studying the innards of the alien Plasma Pistol and Plasma Rifle has given us a basic understanding of the science behind extraterrestrial directed energy weapons. We remain some distance from replicating plasma-based weapons ourselves, even in a laboratory setting, but our work raises the tantalising possibility of battlefield laser weapons.&#10;&#10;A brief explanation of the generation of a plasma bolt is as follows: firstly, the weapon draws power from an Alenium cell and uses it to fuel a powerful array of particle accelerators. Secondly, these accelerators superheat a large number of atoms into a state of ionised gas within the heat-proofed 'chamber' of the weapon. Thirdly, two helical spirals of electromagnets in the barrel of the weapon pulse simultaneously, drawing the plasma from the chamber and spinning it into a bolt while accelerating it to muzzle velocity. Finally, a graviton emitter in the muzzle of the weapon launches a graviton particle into the plasma bolt as it exits the barrel. &#10;&#10;This graviton particle is incredibly important - in laboratory conditions, it has been observed to possess a strong gravitational pull that prevents the bolt from dissipating into a useless cloud of hot gas. The science behind this process is unclear (it is the first time we have observed a graviton), but it probably explains the large difference in range between the alien Plasma Pistol and Plasma Rifle.  Sadly, we have no idea of how to replicate this gravitational field ourselves - and without access to an effective anti-gravity emitter, the useful range of our most powerful lab-based plasma generator is only a few inches. One would hope that study of the more advanced alien weapons may shed more light on the process.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, our efforts would be better focused on the development of battlefield laser technology. We have learned enough from studying the power distribution and cooling systems of the alien weapons that I believe I can replicate them in our own designs, making building man-portable laser weapons from these new alien materials a theoretical possibility.</desc>
<cdesc>对外星等离子手枪和等离子步枪内部结构的研究，使我们对这些外星能量武器背后的科学原理有了初步的了解。即便在实验室环境下，距离制造出我们自己的等离子武器仍然还有一定距离。但是我们的研究工作使得开发出战场激光武器具备了诱人的可能性。&#10;&#10;简要介绍一下等离子子弹的产生过程：首先，等离子武器从Alenium电池中获取能量，并将其注入一个强有力的粒子加速器阵列。然后，这些加速器在武器隔热的内腔中将大量原子加热到离子化气体状态。之后，两个位于枪管中的螺旋状电磁铁同时产生脉冲，将等离子体从内腔中吸出来，使其高速旋转形成等离子子弹，并同时将其加速到初速度（弹出膛时的速度）。最后，一个位于枪口的重力子发生器会发射一个重力子</cdesc>
