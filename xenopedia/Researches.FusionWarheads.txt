<desc>Pure fusion explosives are rather simple to scale up, making it easy to produce air-to-air variants for our interceptors to use. We are upgrading our aircraft munitions to the new Fusion Missile and Fusion Torpedo designs as we speak.&#10;&#10;These Fusion weapons inflict more damage than the Plasma warheads they replace, but otherwise operate in a similar manner. The yield of the warheads is actually rather small compared to what we could achieve (the Fusion Missile is approximately 0.5 kilotons and the Torpedo 2 kilotons), but we have not designed these weapons for nuclear-style indiscriminate destruction. They borrow from the design of the HEAT warheads on our old Avalanche missiles, focusing the explosion into a jet of high-velocity particles designed to pierce armoured UFO hulls. &#10; &#10;To generate this effect, both weapons are fitted with a dense tungsten cone that sits just in front of the warhead. When detonation occurs, the cone is immediately vaporised and the resulting spear of tungsten particles are propelled forwards at hypersonic speeds. This bombardment is capable of causing significant damage by itself, but it also fractures the heat-resistant outermost layer of the armour and leaves the UFO more vulnerable to the immense heat generated by the fusion reaction occurring in the warhead. An extremely effective design, if I say so myself.</desc>
