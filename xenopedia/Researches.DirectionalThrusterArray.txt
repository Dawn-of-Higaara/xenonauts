<desc>Extraterrestrial craft are fascinating for many reasons, not least their extraordinary manuevering ability. Their fighters dance through the air like graceful ballerinas and even their ponderous capital ships can hover in place and turn far more quickly than their size should allow. It seems the recovered Directional Thruster array explains how this is possible.&#10;&#10;The device consists of a central &quot;brain&quot; and a series of rotatable thrusters mounted outside of the ship's hull. These thrusters were clearly originally designed for maneuvering in a vacuum, but during atmospheric flight take on the combined role of wings, stabilisers and elevators. An outer &quot;shell&quot; of tiny flaps, each able to provide tiny amounts of vectored thrust, allows an immense amount of control over the output of each individual thruster. Collectively, a network of a dozen or more of these thrusters gives a craft the ability to perform some fairly remarkable acrobatics. Though this system is hardly energy efficient compared to conventional flight control systems, alien craft generate enough power that this is not a problem.  &#10;&#10;The &quot;brain&quot; is an oval structure roughly the size of a car engine. It contains a crowded arrangement of sensors and a dense mass of biological electronics that we believe automatically stabilises the flight of the UFO based on the incoming sensor data. Unfortunately, this biological brain would be too complex to replicate - but it may be possible to substitute it. Automated control systems for spacecraft have been around for almost twenty years, so I imagine with a little time my team would be able to adapt and improve the existing designs to create something capable of controlling a few of these thrusters. We may not be able to create a system as elegant as the extraterrestrial one, but even a basic solution could dramatically improve the performance of our interceptors and dropships. </desc>
