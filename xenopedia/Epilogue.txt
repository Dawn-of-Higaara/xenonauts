<desc>The radar screens are silent. The death of the High Praetor has reduced the aliens held in our labs to a catatonic state; even our captured Praetor is utterly unresponsive. It seems the war is finally over.&#10;&#10;Humanity is rightly celebrating our victory â€“ the sacrifices made by the brave men and women of our organisation will echo through the ages. Though nobody has done more than I to ensure the survival of the human race, I have little doubt your name will be written into history just below my own. This does not mean our mission is over: the world will not simply return to how it was before the invasion began. It is inevitable that our new technology will drastically alter the balance of world power; even one of our singularity cores produces sufficient energy to supply the entire planet for centuries. &#10;&#10;The squabbling has already begun. Some are already lobbying for our organisation to be placed under Soviet or American oversight. This technology could be used for the benefit of all humanity, irrespective of race or creed. Our backers instead seek to turn my inventions to their own narrow ends. But who better to decide the shape of our new world than those who saved it? We have bargaining chips of our own: direct control of both the cores themselves and the most sophisticated military force on the planet. I could annihilate the entire planet in the blink of an eye if I so chose. Are they really in a position to dictate to us?&#10;&#10;The Xenonauts were established to protect humanity, Commander.  You did exceptional work to protect us from the extraterrestrial menace; you must now plot a path that protects us from ourselves.</desc>
