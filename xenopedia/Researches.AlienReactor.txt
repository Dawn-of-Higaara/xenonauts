<desc>The alien Reactor is the size of a small car, consisting of a horizontal cylinder mounted in a curved shell of alien alloys. Despite some visual similarities with the UFO Power Source, the Reactor is a far more intricate creation and generates nearly ten times more energy than its smaller cousin.&#10;&#10;It does this using exactly the same Alenium core as the Power Source, without any extra method of power generation. The Reactor is actually more efficient at harvesting the energy already being emitted - it seems that the Power Source represents the simplest method of utilising Alenium, easy to construct but not particularly space-efficient. The alien Reactor is used in situations where extra power is needed, but scaling the Power Source up by a factor of ten would not be viable. The utility becomes obvious when you remember that drag increases exponentially with size and observe that enemy capital ships are getting larger &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; faster.&#10;&#10;The Reactor is able to capture all this additional energy by harnessing the power of gamma rays. The breakdown of chemical bonds in Alenium seems to release a burst of gamma radiation in addition to the heat that fuels our current reactors.  This gamma burst is incredibly energetic but also extremely focused (an unfocused burst of this magnitude would be extremely dangerous) and angled towards six narrow cylindrical tubes of a superdense alien alloy that radiate out from the core like the spokes on a bicycle wheel. This material absorbs the gamma radiation and is rapidly heated by the bombardment of high-energy particles, generating an immense amount of extra useful energy in the form of heat. Overall, it is a simple but effective design, and one I see no major difficulty in replicating in our own technology.</desc>
