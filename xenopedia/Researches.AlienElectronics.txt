<desc>Recovered examples of alien electronics provide a fascinating window into the future, allowing us to study countless innovations the extraterrestrials use to reduce electronic noise. Recreating existing circuitry with alien materials whilst integrating a few of the simpler alien innovations into the design increases their efficiency by at least a factor of ten, a quite remarkable improvement.&#10;&#10;The aliens utilise organic compounds such as amino acids in their electronic components, which collectively appear to grant the circuit a limited degree of latent intelligence. This organic computing power continuously analyses the power demand in the network and channels energy to where it is needed most, either storing or releasing charge from dozens of integrated capacitors when necessary. The end result is a biological smart-grid that can reduce power consumption by almost fifty percent; the aliens do not just have access to vastly larger amounts of energy than us, they also use it more efficiently too.&#10;&#10;Our crude reproductions of these organic circuits are nowhere near as efficient as the alien equivalents, but will still be very useful when building complex machines such as vehicles or aircraft. A helpful side-effect of the intelligent power routing is increased survivability, as the power transmission systems will automatically bypass damaged components in a way that conventional systems cannot. </desc>
