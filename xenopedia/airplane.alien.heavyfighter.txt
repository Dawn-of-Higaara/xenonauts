<desc>The Heavy Fighter is a small alien air superiority craft. It is much tougher than the Fighter UFO and possesses weapons systems capable of shredding a conventional interceptor such as the Condor in moments. &#10;&#10;The wings of the vessel house most of the vital systems (avionics, thrusters, weapons), with surviving fragments suggesting that all of these are significantly more advanced than their equivalents on the basic Fighter. It seems that the craft houses a reactor in each wing, making significantly more power available to the various components - this is probably what makes the Heavy Fighter so much more formidable than its predecessor.&#10;&#10;Dismantling the central saucer reveals the identity of the pilots. A Harridan lies sealed inside the craft's saucer, curled into the foetal position and plugged directly into the UFO's sensors and control systems. The creature's armour draws power from the craft reactor and provides all required life support functions, making it likely that the pilots are permanently incarcerated within their craft when built.</desc>
