<desc>The F-17 Condor is the primary Xenonaut interceptor aircraft, a general purpose dogfighter derived from the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Condor's Autocannon makes it well-suited to destroying smaller craft, whilst it also carries Sidewinder light missiles to make it a credible threat to medium-size vessels.&#10;&#10;The Condor has broadly similar performance to its parent aircraft but uses a modified airframe built from a titanium / magnesium alloy that gives the interceptor a reduced payload, but significantly longer range and improved durability. The alterations to the airframe have been made based on our studies of F-4 Phantoms damaged during the Iceland Incident. Components containing titanium or magnesium appeared to sustain less damage than those made of aluminium or other materials, suggesting some inherent resistance to alien energy weapons. We hope this reinforced airframe will make our Condors more capable against alien UFOs than interceptors from conventional air forces. &#10;&#10;The increased range is believed necessary - we have rather a lot of planet to protect. This has reduced the payload of the Condor, but it is still able to carry two light missiles and a craft cannon. This is a versatile combination; Sidewinder missiles have been proved effective and reliable against human aircraft, but we do not even know if we will be able to get a missile lock on alien vessels. The cannon has a shorter range and fires powerful shells that should be useful in a dogfight. One of the two weapons should hopefully prove effective against an enemy vessel.</desc>
