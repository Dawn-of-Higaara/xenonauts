<desc>The X-120 &quot;Fury&quot; interceptor is the ultimate weapon in the battle for our skies. It is an unmanned craft with virtually unlimited range that can fly so high and so fast that no UFO has a hope of outrunning it, let alone intercepting it. It can travel at Mach 8 (some 10,000 kilometers per hour), allowing it to reach any point in the world in under two hours. It carries a single super-heavy Singularity Torpedo on each mission.&#10;&#10;The Fury was influenced by the allegedly secret SR-71 &quot;Blackbird&quot;, which is almost invulnerable to conventional technology due to its impressive speed and service ceiling (not that our organisation would have much trouble dealing with them). The design has been evolved and enhanced, not least by removing the pilot and the equipment required to keep him alive. An autonomous flight computer tracks sensor data against mission parameters, adjusting its behaviour to ensure the mission is completed as quickly and safely as possible. The engines are a three-stage turbojet / ramjet / scramjet design where each stage speed the craft to the point at which the following stage can kick in.&#10;&#10;The scramjets engage at Mach 4 and each produce 75,000 lbs. of thrust, rapidly accelerating the Fury to Mach 8. At these speeds air resistance heats the surface of the craft to 4,000 degrees Celsius, ordinarily impossible to sustain without a spacecraft-style ablative coating that requires replacement after every flight. However, hardened alien alloys have proved more than capable of resisting that sort of temperature indefinitely - allowing the Fury to travel so quickly that it is entirely immune to damage from enemy UFOs. Unfortunately, as weapons also need to be designed specifically for hypersonic launch, the speed of the craft also limits the weapons that can be carried to just one: the super-heavy Singularity Torpedo.&#10;&#10;Unsurprisingly, the power requirements for these monstrous engines and the highly advanced flight computer are enormous. A Singularity Core is the only viable power source, so each Fury built will require us to capture one from an extraterrestrial capital ship.</desc>
