<desc>Studying alien electronics taught us much about how to create them, but we also learned how to destroy them. This was largely accidental - my team destroyed alien electrical systems on several occasions by running an overly large current through them, while your engineers helpfully demonstrated that they were also vulnerable to being dropped on the floor. Though I was not particularly amused at the time, the knowledge gained eventually proved useful.&#10;&#10;I present you with the Electroshock Grenade. It generates a powerful electromagnetic discharge on detonation, inflicting major EMP damage on any mechanical unit caught in the blast and stun damage on biological ones (as there is no explosive component in the device the terrain will remain completely unaffected). The stunning effect of the grenade is not quite as powerful as that generated by a stun baton, but this is offset by the greater range. This will be of great relief to your men: I have noted the soldiers assigned to capture duty (&quot;shock-jocks&quot;) appear to have significantly lower morale than the others.&#10;&#10;The Electroshock Grenade is also very useful for destroying robotic enemy units. The EMP pulse completely bypasses the target's armour and overloads the electronic systems underneath. The actual damage inflicted is only average at best, but could still prove very useful against well-protected extraterrestrial drones and robots that are difficult to damage through conventional means.</desc>
