<desc>As improving our plasma technology to the point where it surpassed that of the aliens would be virtually impossible, new ideas were needed. They arrived in the form of old ideas. MAG weapons are electromagnetic coilguns that combine the remarkable properties of alien materials with our existing knowledge of ballistic weapons.&#10;&#10;The idea behind a Gauss gun / coilgun has been around for over a century and consists of a series of electromagnets firing sequentially, accelerating a projectile along the barrel of the weapon to deadly speeds. The parallels with alien plasma weapons should be obvious - but while the plasma technology uses the electromagnetic acceleration as a means to an end, a coilgun uses it as a means in itself. The technology can be adapted from existing plasma weapon designs and has some significant advantage, e.g. an energy projectile does mostly thermal damage and can be partially absorbed / reflected / dissipated by a number of factors, atmospheric conditions included. A spot of rain will not offer much protection against a metal pellet travelling at five times the speed of sound.&#10;&#10;MAG weapon prototypes have been built in Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle and Precision arrangements, each one small enough to be carried by an infantryman but still capable of delivering a pellet of alien alloy at hypersonic speed. They are almost certainly the most powerful terrestrial infantry weapons that will ever exist - pushing muzzle velocity any higher would raise air resistance highly enough to explosively ignite the air behind the projectile (likely killing the soldier firing the weapon). It seems we are now limited by the composition of our atmosphere rather than by our technology. </desc>
