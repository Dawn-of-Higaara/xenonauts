<desc>Whether they be within a few kilometers of one another or on opposite sides of the solar system, alien craft employ radio signals to communicate with one another. Their long-range transmissions are compressed to a remarkable degree - only a few fleeting nanoseconds of signal can carry all the data the aliens need.&#10;&#10;The short duration of these transmissions makes it extremely difficult to capture any fleet-level alien communications, but the sheer quantity of radio receivers on our planet means that a few examples have been recorded purely by chance. There are literally thousands of intelligence operatives across the planet who are working to crack the encryption codes, but the extraterrestrials are using quantum-level cryptology. It is highly unlikely that humanity could crack the codes in the lifetime of our galaxy, let alone that of a human being (so it is open to debate whether our attempts to do so should be considered inspirational or grossly stupid).&#10;&#10;Anyway, a far more effective solution would be to capture a device capable of decrypting the signal. The decryption devices aboard UFOs captured to date have proved completely inert, apparently requiring an alien user. However, one of the artefacts your men recovered from the captured alien base appears to be a communications array capable of sending transmissions - so once it was set up to transmit in our laboratories, we could reverse-engineer the encryption methods in a matter of hours. We can use this knowledge to design a base structure that will decode the transmissions sent by alien vessels, giving us additional information on their composition and intent.&#10;&#10;Incidentally, the transmission that the rest of the world is so desperately working to decode is the autopsy report of an unfortunate freshwater salmon abducted and dissected by the alien forces. I think it best to keep that to ourselves. </desc>
