<desc>The X-37 Corsair is the first aircraft designed specifically for fighting extraterrestrial craft. We have made extensive use of alien materials when designing the airframe and used materials known to be resistant to alien weapons for everything else - producing an aircraft that is faster, tougher and no less agile than our F-17 Condor interceptors. It is not capable of carrying heavy torpedoes, so should complement the Foxtrot rather than replace it.&#10;&#10;In many respects, the design of the craft is evolutionary rather than revolutionary - it is an immense undertaking to design an entire aircraft in such a short time, even for someone as intelligent as myself. Many of the gains have been made by reproducing existing systems using more efficient alien materials / manufacturing techniques, but we have made two main innovations - introduction of a variable-sweep wing design and the new ER-3 Alenium Impulsion reactor / turbine system. The latter produces twice as much thrust as a conventional jet turbine, the former increasing maneuverability at low speed while also increasing performance at high speeds. As a result, the Corsair can cruise at almost 3,000 km/h despite the extra armour making it larger and heavier than its predecessor.&#10;&#10;Construction of each Corsair represents a significant investment of time, money and alien materials, but I have little doubt that conventional aircraft will rapidly become obsolete as the invasion escalates further. </desc>
