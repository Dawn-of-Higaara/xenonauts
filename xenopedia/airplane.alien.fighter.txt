<desc>The Fighter is a very small UFO apparently designed for air supremacy. It is faster and tougher than the Light Scout, and surprisingly well-armed for its size. Though not individually a match for an F-17 Condor, I doubt a lone F-17 would stand much chance against a full squadron of three.&#10;&#10;The most interesting feature of this design is the absence of a pressurised crew compartment; virtually the entirety of the saucer consists of propulsion systems, sensors and weapon arrays. This initially led us to believe the craft was unmanned, but analysis of the wreckage revealed enough biological material to convince us otherwise. We are unsure exactly what form this pilot takes (there is only room for one), but the lack of a transparent canopy or control systems implies they are much more heavily integrated with their craft than human pilots are.&#10;&#10;The Fighter's primary armament is a short-ranged, rapid-fire energy weapon much like the craft cannon on our F-17s. However, it also carries a pair of longer-ranged homing plasma projectiles that act more like missiles. Quite what these devices are and how they work is unknown, as Fighters tend to explode so spectacularly when destroyed that there is little left to study. Whatever the culprit, I doubt we will be recovering an intact version any time soon. </desc>
<cdesc>战斗机是最小的UFO单位，而且显然是用于夺取制空权的。他比侦察机更快更坚固，并且在这个大小上出人意料的防护良好。尽管它与F-17单打独斗不能占上风，但我对于F-17能打赢3个一队的这种战斗机持怀疑态度。&#10;&#10;这种战斗机最有趣的设计师没有加压机组仓；实际上整个飞碟内的由推进系统、传感器和武器阵列组成。这让我们初步认定飞船其实是无人驾驶的，但是通过分析飞船残骸的生物信息让我们得出了相反的结论。我们不确定驾驶员变成了什么样子（这里只有一个人的空间），但是缺失的机舱顶盖和控制系统暗示我们，外星驾驶员比人类驾驶员更加紧密地与飞船融合在了一起。&#10;&#10;战斗机的主要武装是一个短程的、能够快速攻击地能量武器，与F-17的机载火炮一样。但是，它还携带有一对长程自动跟踪电浆炮弹，就像导弹一样。关于这些设备到底是什么以及他们如何工作的都还是未知数，因为战斗机总是在毁坏时炸成碎片，以至于没剩下什么能研究的部分。不管它是什么样的，我都对于短时间内恢复其全貌表示怀疑。</cdesc>
