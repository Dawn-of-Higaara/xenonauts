<desc>Much of the explosive power of a conventional two-stage thermonuclear / hydrogen bomb comes from the initial fission explosion that ignites the fusion reaction, rather than the fusion reaction itself. Unfortunately, the initial fission explosion also causes the lethal radioactive fallout that can linger for decades afterwards. &#10;&#10;Pure fusion explosives are smaller, cleaner and more deadly still. Only a commander with minimal attachment to his infantry would issue them with short-range thermonuclear weapons...but pure fusion micro-explosives are perfectly viable battlefield weapons. They are extremely powerful and can be made small enough that the user would not be caught in the blast of their own weapon, whilst the clean reaction means they can be used freely in friendly territory without fear of radioactive contamination.&#10;&#10;All that is required for a pure fusion explosive is a burst of energy that sufficiently powerful to ignite fusion between the deuterium and tritium in the warhead. Low-grade Alenium contains enough energy to do this without any of the side-effects of a fission bomb, allowing us to develop pure fusion rockets / grenades for your men that are significantly more powerful than the previous plasma explosives. However, please ensure that your men use the darkened glasses / visors provided - whilst I accept they are not particularly fashionable, I doubt catastrophic retinal burns are considered particularly attractive either. </desc>
