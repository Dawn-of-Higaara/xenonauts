<desc>Our enemies are members of a vast stellar empire that spans several galaxies and hundreds of planets; this invasion fleet is only a tiny fraction of their military might (although considered more than enough to deal with us). This empire has existed for millennia, linked by ships that can travel interstellar distances in days. With no rivals to define itself against, it seemingly has no name. They believe no other interstellar civilisation exists, or ever has.&#10;&#10;This empire is ruled by a caste of living god-creatures known as the Praetors. While the lesser creatures are clones that follow orders unquestioningly, these Praetors seem distinct individuals locked in an endless struggle with one another for power and influence. Low-ranking praetors are apparently present on the largest alien craft / bases, overseeing the work of their underlings directly. These creatures will surely know the true reason why the extraterrestrials have travelled to our planet, the real reasons behind the invasion. We must capture one alive, whatever the cost may be.&#10;&#10;I have little doubt the task will be difficult. During the questioning of our captive, I could not help but notice the interrogation team becoming steadily less adversarial - indeed, after six hours, they had almost become friendly. Alarmed, I called a halt to the experiment and had the captive terminated. It emerged that one of my scientists had slipped into a trance during the interrogation and surreptitiously begun building a bomb large enough to blow up half the facility. Given a few more hours, he might well have finished the job. Dark days, Commander: it appears these creatures are capable of manipulating our very minds.</desc>
<cdesc>我们的敌人来自一个毁灭了数以万计星系和行星的恒星。这次侵略的舰队只是他们雄厚军事力量的一小部分罢了（然后敌方认为这只舰队对付我们已经绰绰有余了）。这个外星帝国已经在宇宙中存在了上千年，拥有可以在几天内横穿星际的飞船。似乎从来没遇到过对手，这个帝国没有名字。帝国的居民都深信除他们之外，没有其他星系文明存在，或者说从来没有存在过。&#10;&#10;帝国是由一个都是金色生物的阶级统治的，称之为“Praetors”-地方官。</cdesc>
