<desc>Further study of the alien Singularity Core has allowed us to weaponise it without consuming the Core itself - important not simply because the Cores are in short supply, but because they contain so much energy that releasing it all at once would annihilate literally everything in the combat area.  The Singularity Cannon is so heavy that it can only be wielded with assistance from a Predator battlesuit, but it is capable of unleashing almost unimaginable destructive power.&#10;&#10;The device is built around a Singularity Core and functions by siphoning off a tiny fraction of the energy held within, then imparting it into a specially-designed slug of alien materials. This slug consists largely of looped superconducting alloys, the only substances able to contain the enormous quantity of energy involved. The slug is then projected at high speed towards the target using our existing MAG technology, deforming on impact and thus breaking the superconductor loop. This causes a vast release of energy and similarly enormous damage to anything that happens to be in the area. The effect is not quite as extreme as the blast from one of our Singularity Torpedoes, but the results are still astonishing.&#10;&#10;The Singularity Cannon requires reloading with a new slug after each time it is fired, but the Core itself should be good for approximately a million shots. Constructing one would be a major undertaking, but the sheer power of the weapon would surely be worth it - I seriously doubt the aliens have anything that could survive a hit from this weapon; I can assure you that our species does not.</desc>
