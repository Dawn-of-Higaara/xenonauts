<desc>Study of an alien facility requires an intelligence report, Commander, not a research report. I have intercepted the dispatch from our esteemed Chief Scientist and replaced his self-indulgent prattle with something useful.&#10;&#10;There are two structures of tactical importance in an underground alien base. The first is the base power core, which should be easily identifiable by their blue glow. They provide power to the entire base, but most crucially they drive the life support systems that maintain the atmosphere at the correct level of oxygenation to allow the aliens to survive. If this core is destroyed, the base will exhaust backup power within the hour and the crew will begin to suffer from oxygen toxicity. It is almost certain that the aliens will self-destruct the base to avoid it falling into enemy hands (though whether they will evacuate the crew first is debatable). If your goal is simply to destroy the base, then you only need destroy this core and then withdraw your men from the facility.&#10;&#10;If you are interested in capturing the base and recovering the technology contained within, you will need to assault the other important structure - the command room. This is the nerve centre of the alien base, containing the alien commander and his guards. They are the most fearsome units in the base, but will not move from their location if the facility falls under attack. I believe their primary duty is to protect the base commander, presumably an important figure in the alien hierarchy and potentially with access to sensitive information. If this is the case, death would be preferable to his capture (from the alien point of view, at least). Assaulting the command room and clearing the base of all extraterrestrials is much more dangerous than simply destroying the power cores and withdrawing, but the rewards are correspondingly higher. The ultimate choice of strategy lies with you, Commander, but hopefully you are now aware of all of the options.&#10;&#10;P.S. My apologies for not including any mixing of imperial and metric units in this report, but then some things are perhaps best left to the most brilliant minds among us.</desc>
