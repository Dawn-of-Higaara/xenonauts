<desc>Good news, Commander. I have developed a method of shaping captured alien alloys, allowing us to incorporate them into our designs for the first time. This is largely a result of tapping the vast reserves of energy locked away inside our stores of Alenium; though the foundry processes are a little more complex than simply blasting the materials with our upgraded laboratory lasers until they melt, for the sake of brevity I will leave the explanation at that.&#10;&#10;Needless to say, this is a discovery of enormous significance. We can vastly improve the efficiency of our existing technology with alien materials, but they also open the door to ideas that seemed impossible only a few weeks ago. The frontiers of science have moved more in the past few months than they did in the previous century; some of these alloys have properties that barely even exist in theoretical science. I must admit that my team are struggling with the pace of advance - we are sometimes as much limited by our scientific education as we are enlightened by it.&#10;&#10;The proposal for developing improved battlefield infantry armour with these materials may therefore seem a little underwhelming, but it marks only the start of what we can achieve. I would not be surprised if we were building whole vehicles or entire aircraft out of them soon.  In the meantime, if you see any off-duty scientists strolling around the base, please remind them that: (a) they should be in bed, and that (b) research materials should stay within the laboratory at all times. The number of unauthorised &quot;upgrades&quot; appearing across the base is matched only by the amount of yawning in my labs. </desc>
