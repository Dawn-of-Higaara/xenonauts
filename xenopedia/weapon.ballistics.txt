<desc>Our ballistic weapons are conventional firearms, provided in unlimited quantities by our backers. We have four main classes of normal weapon (heavy weapons will be discussed separately), and I will provide a brief summary of the strengths and weaknesses of each below:&#10;&#10;The Pistol is a single-handed weapon with a short range and relatively low damage, but one that can be fired very quickly. It is a perfectly capable weapon at close ranges, but is primarily useful as a sidearm (e.g. for snipers) or when the soldier has something else in their other hand (e.g. a grenade or a combat shield). Also, please note that absolutely no combat advantage is gained by dual-wielding these weapons. It is simply childish.&#10;&#10;The Shotgun fires shells that break into several shots, making it most effective when the spread is small and all of the shot strikes a single target. It can be fired relatively quickly and does considerable damage at short-range, but it is completely ineffective at long range. It is best used as a breaching weapon and for close-quarter work, where it can bring down hostile units faster than our other weapons.&#10;&#10;The Assault Rifle is the most versatile of our weapons, accurate at all ranges and capable of burst fire. It cannot be fired as quickly as the Pistol / Shotgun and it does not do as much damage as other weapons, but it is useful in practically any situation. It is always worth having a backbone of rifle-armed troops on combat missions.&#10;&#10;The Precision Rifle is a marksman's rifle. It does additional damage per shot than the Rifle and is more accurate, but takes additional time to aim and cannot use burst fire. It is not a very efficient weapon at short range, but it is king where there are large open spaces and good sight lines.</desc>
