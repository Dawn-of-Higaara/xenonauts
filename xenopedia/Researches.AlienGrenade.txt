<desc>The Alien Grenade is a small explosive used in a similar way to conventional human grenades. The ceramic shell contains a small plasma generation array activated by pressing a button on the top of device. Unlike the generation array alien infantry weapons, the Alien Grenade makes no attempt to focus or shape the resulting projectile - instead it exhausts its entire Alenium power supply in a single moment and dumps all of the plasma into the surrounding area in the form of a sizeable explosion.&#10;&#10;There is thus no fragmentation element to the damage inflicted by the Alien Grenade - it is purely an energy weapon. This gives the device a relatively limited blast radius and a rapid drop-off in power from the epicenter of the blast to the edge, but also means that it will be deadly to any units caught near the middle of the blast until we develop more advanced infantry body armour. It is highly recommended that commanders avoid bunching their troops together in a manner that may attract an Alien Grenade.&#10;&#10;Additionally, our scientists have adapted the design of the Alien Grenade to create the Alenium Grenade. This device contains a core of Alenium crystals studded with miniaturised lasers, surrounded by a conventional fragmentation shell fabricated from Alien Alloys. Once triggered, the Alenium crystals detonate and propel the razor-sharp shrapnel through the blast area at far higher speeds than a normal grenade can muster. &#10;&#10;Preliminary tests suggest that the Alenium Grenade has a similar blast radius to the conventional Fragmentation Grenade, but inflicts up to 50% more damage to anything caught within. These grenades are now available for production in the Workshop.</desc>
