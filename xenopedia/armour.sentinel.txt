<desc>The S-6 &quot;Sentinel&quot; Battlesuit is a combat exoskeleton designed for general combat usage. It offers less protection than our S-2 &quot;Predator&quot; exoskeletons, but incorporates a personal jump unit and is not limited to using only heavy weapons. The helmet also features a unique camera system that allows the wearer 360-degree vision.&#10;&#10;The Sentinel contains thousands of tiny sensors that work to detect and augment the wearer's movement, making it operate more like a second skin than a half-tonne armoured suit.  It is capable of the same dexterity and range of motion as an unarmoured soldier, whilst also providing amplified strength and excellent protection. The helmet contains a full rebreather system (rendering the wearer immune to smoke and gas effects) and a variety of sensors and cameras linked directly to the helmet visor, giving the wearer unparalleled awareness of the battlefield around them. The jump unit does away with the miniaturised jet turbines of the Buzzard and utilises alien antigravity technology instead, resulting in a much more compact device that also contains the suit reactor.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that this level of precision engineering would simply not be possible if the Sentinel were armoured as heavily as the Predator. The more primitive design still excels at soaking up damage and remains our best option for assault work, but the Sentinel is far more versatile in combat. A mixture of the two designs would be a powerful combination; taken together they represent the final word in the development of battlefield protection.</desc>
