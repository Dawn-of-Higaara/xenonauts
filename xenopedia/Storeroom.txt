<desc>The Storeroom of a base houses all manufactured or recovered equipment at the base. This is not required for items that are available in unlimited quantities - so aircraft weapons / ammunition or ballistic weapons for your soldiers will still be available without a Storeroom. However, the base cannot receive any manufactured soldier weapons or armour until it has storage space for them, nor collect any Alenium / alien alloys.&#10;&#10;A single Storeroom is capable of holding an unlimited quantity of items.</desc>
