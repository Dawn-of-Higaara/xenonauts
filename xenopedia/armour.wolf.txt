<desc>The &quot;Wolf&quot; Battle Armour is a direct replacement for the Jackal Combat Armour, using the remarkable properties of alien alloys to provide extra protection to your men in combat. Each individual suit requires a large amount of money and alien alloys to fabricate in our workshops, but they should dramatically increase the combat effectiveness of our men.&#10;&#10;Wolf armour consists of numerous parts: an armoured helmet with a reinforced visor, thick torso protector plates, armoured pads for the shoulder, elbow and knee joints, plus ballistic gloves and combat boots atop a fire-resistant undersuit. Collectively, this offers dramatically improved resistance to injury. The centimetre-thick breastplate is capable of stopping a .50cal round at point blank range; it is the equivalent of walking around with three inches of steel strapped to your chest. Both the plating and the undersuit have also been impregnated with a dense network of ultrafine superconductor filaments, which absorb the heat from an energy projectile and dissipate it across the full surface of the armour, giving the soldier underneath a much improved chance of surviving the impact.&#10;&#10;None of this appears to have dramatically improved the mood of your soldiers. Indeed, I cannot recall a single smile from the miserable sods since the invasion began - it is almost as if they do not realise quite how difficult working in the laboratories can be. A little more gratitude would hardly go amiss.</desc>
