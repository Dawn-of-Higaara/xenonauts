<desc>The D-42 Shrike is a VTOL aircraft that combines the functionality of a helicopter with the performance of a conventional aircraft. It is a major upgrade on the CH-48 Charlie, being much faster and able to carry more troops. It is also better equipped for operating in urban spaces; any mission that involves large helicopters disembarking troops in built-up areas is a recipe for disaster - indeed, it is testament to the skill of our pilots that none of our missions have begun with a bungled landing and deadly fireball.&#10;&#10;The Shrike is a rugged, boxy creation that is as effective as it is ugly. It uses a pair of tilting TF-19 turbofan engines to cruise through the air at supersonic speeds and then perform a vertical landing on arrival at the target site. These monstrous turbines are themselves driven by two sizeable ER-12 Alenium reactors, providing enough power to keep even a fully-loaded craft airborne for days - in fact, the range limitation of the craft is due to pilot fatigue rather than fuel capacity.&#10;&#10;However, the most important result of these new engines is a greater carrying capacity than the CH-48 Charlie. The Shrike can carry up to ten soldiers (rather than eight) inside its armoured troop compartment, which has large ramps at both the front and the rear to allow safer disembarkation in a hazardous landing zone. One does not need a brain as large as mine to see that bringing  a quarter more soldiers into battle will significantly increase our chances of victory.</desc>
