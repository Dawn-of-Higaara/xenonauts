<desc>Radar Array structures allow a base to detect extraterrestrial UFOs. The detection radius of the base is shown as a blue circle on the Geoscape; any UFOs that enter this circle will be detected almost immediately irrespective of distance from the facility.&#10;&#10;The radar range of a base can be expanded by constructing additional Radar Arrays, however this will only apply three times (i.e. there is no point building a fourth Radar Array). </desc>
