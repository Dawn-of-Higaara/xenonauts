<desc>The S-2 &quot;Predator&quot; Assault Armour is a powered personal exoskeleton designed for heavy assault and breaching action. It offers exceptional protection and is powerful enough to wield heavy weapons without suffering movement or recoil penalties, transforming the wearer into a fearsome walking tank.&#10;&#10;The Predator's main armour plates are nearly an inch thick and formed from hardened alien alloys, whilst the joints use sliding layers of thinner plates to offer both flexibility and strength - even at its weakest point, the armour is still a centimetre thick. The backplate unit contains both the SA-16 personal Alenium reactor (which generates enough power to keep the suit operating at full capacity virtually indefinitely) and rebreather apparatus that renders the wearer completely immune to environmental toxins. Conventional measures of protection are almost meaningless by this point, but a Predator could wade through molten lava or withstand a small nuclear blast with little more than superficial damage.&#10;&#10;The suit uses powerful servomotors that give it functional strength two or three times greater than the average human. This allows the wearer to operate heavy automatic weapons as if they were normal weapons, able to fire on the move and their accuracy unaffected by recoil. Nor is the wearer slowed by the weight of their equipment; even the heaviest load is of little consequence to a Predator. Nor, indeed, are walls - the sheer bulk of the suit means it can charge straight through many of them with no ill-effects whatsoever.&#10;&#10;However, the design is limited by its view cone and weapon selection. The reduced spatial awareness caused by the enclosed helmet is compounded by the poor peripheral vision granted by the cameras, effectively giving the wearer a permanent case of tunnel vision. Additionally, the massive armoured gauntlets of the Predator are simply too large and clumsy to use much of our equipment. Heavy weapons can be modified easily enough, but the battlesuit cannot use lighter weapons or other equipment like grenades, stun weapons and protective shields. Much like an actual tank, a Predator will require infantry support if it is to be fully effective.</desc>
<cdesc>S-2“捕食者”突击护甲是一具配备动力的单兵体外骨骼，设计用于强力突袭行动。它提供了优异的防护性，并足以用于操作重型武器而免于受到后坐力位移的困扰，使穿着者化身为令人生畏的移动坦克。&#10;&#10;“捕食者”的主装甲厚达一英尺，由外星合金淬炼成型，而接合处则使用轻型装甲组成的滑动层，以提供机动性与坚固性——护甲最薄弱的部位仍有一厘米厚。背板部件包含了 SA-16 Alenium 单兵反应堆（用于产生足够的能量，保证防护套装长期运行于满负荷状态）以及可使穿着者免受环境毒素危害的循环呼吸装置。评估防护性的常规方法至此已毫无意义，换句话说“捕食者”可以涉过熔融岩浆或承受小型核爆而仅有浅表损伤。&#10;&#10;本防护套装使用强大的伺服马达，使其功能性力量超过普通人类两至三倍。这就允许穿着者像操作常规武器一样操作重型自动武器，可以完成行进间精确射击而不受后坐力影响。Nor is the wearer slowed by the weight of their equipment; even the heaviest load is of little consequence to a Predator.
