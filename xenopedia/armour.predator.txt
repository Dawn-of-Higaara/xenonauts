<desc>The S-2 &quot;Predator&quot; Assault Armour is a powered personal exoskeleton designed for heavy assault and breaching action. It offers exceptional protection and is powerful enough to wield heavy weapons without suffering movement or recoil penalties, transforming the wearer into a fearsome walking tank.&#10;&#10;The Predator's main armour plates are nearly an inch thick and formed from hardened alien alloys, whilst the joints use sliding layers of thinner plates to offer both flexibility and strength - even at its weakest point, the armour is still a centimetre thick. The backplate unit contains both the SA-16 personal Alenium reactor (which generates enough power to keep the suit operating at full capacity virtually indefinitely) and rebreather apparatus that renders the wearer completely immune to environmental toxins. Conventional measures of protection are almost meaningless by this point, but a Predator could wade through molten lava or withstand a small nuclear blast with little more than superficial damage.&#10;&#10;The suit uses powerful servomotors that give it functional strength two or three times greater than the average human. This allows the wearer to operate heavy automatic weapons as if they were normal weapons, able to fire on the move and their accuracy unaffected by recoil. Nor is the wearer slowed by the weight of their equipment; even the heaviest load is of little consequence to a Predator. Nor, indeed, are walls - the sheer bulk of the suit means it can charge straight through many of them with no ill-effects whatsoever.&#10;&#10;However, the design is limited by its view cone and weapon selection. The reduced spatial awareness caused by the enclosed helmet is compounded by the poor peripheral vision granted by the cameras, effectively giving the wearer a permanent case of tunnel vision. Additionally, the massive armoured gauntlets of the Predator are simply too large and clumsy to use much of our equipment. Heavy weapons can be modified easily enough, but the battlesuit cannot use lighter weapons or other equipment like grenades, stun weapons and protective shields. Much like an actual tank, a Predator will require infantry support if it is to be fully effective.</desc>
