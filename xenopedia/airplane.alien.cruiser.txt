<desc>The Cruiser is a large alien capital ship.  It is a versatile general-purpose warship capable of filling multiple roles, crewed by still more extraterrestrials than the Landing Ship (despite the latter being a dedicated transport ship).&#10;&#10;It consists of a two-level central saucer section containing the command room (upper floor) and a large cargo bay (lower floor), flanked by two &quot;wings&quot; that sweep forward on either side. The majority of the craft's support systems are housed in the wings, most notably the life support systems on the inside and the fine maneuvering thrusters on the exterior edge. The pressurised crew compartments contain both cargo space and the vessel's reactors, leaving space in the saucer for extra armour plate and the main weapon - a powerful plasma cannon, apparently scaled-up from the Corvette cannon. &#10;&#10;Interestingly, the protective armour plating has an uneven distribution. The upper section of the saucer protects the command room and has armour over twice as thick as that of the wings, making it highly resistant to incoming fire (one would imagine it also offers added protection for alien assault squads on the final approach to the designated terror site). That said, even the &quot;vulnerable&quot; wings are still extensively armoured - so expect the Cruiser to take quite a beating before it finally crashes.</desc>
